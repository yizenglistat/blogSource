A tutorial for GAN with an intuitive guide.

The **G**nerative **A**dversarial **N**etwork (GAN) is used to generate "realistic" new data given a training set. 

Let's start with an example. Suppose we have a vector $z$ sampled from a normal distribution as below. 

$$z=\begin{bmatrix}
-0.3\\\\
0.4\\\\
-0.5
\end{bmatrix}$$

Our target for this example is to generate a long vector so that it could be reshaped into a digital image.
